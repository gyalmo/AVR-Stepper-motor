# AVR-Stepper-motor
An AVR code to control the stepper motor 

# Stepper motor:

Stepper motors are DC motors that move in discrete steps. They have multiple coils that are organized in groups called "phases". By energizing each phase in sequence, the motor will rotate, one step at a time.

# In the program we will control the stepper motor based on the following condition:
- The door is connected with the shaft of the stepper motor,
- the IR sensor is attached to the door. 
- If an object is detected through an IR sensor,
- then the door will open 80 degree,
- otherwise th e door will remain closed i.e, 10 degree.
